                taken a step back from them since.<br><br>I grew up playing games like Putt-Putt, Freddi Fish, Spy Fox, Pajama Sam, The Mummy Mystery: Starring Mercer Mayer's Little Monster 
                Private Eye, and Backyard Soccer. One Christmas, I received a Nintendo Wii, which I still have to this day. That console provided me entertainment for years with 
                games like Mario Super Sluggers, Super Mario Galaxy, Call of Duty: World at War, Ghost Squad, Conduit 2, Lego Star Wars, and Goldeneye 007. Let me tell you, I was 
                undefeatable in Goldeneye when I had the golden gun. Eventually, I would take the leap into massive multiplayer online games like World of Jumpstart, Lego Universe, 
                Star Wars: Clone Adventures, Wizard101, and a bit of Minecraft and Roblox on the side. The first three of those, sadly, have been shut down.<br><br>My first jump into 
                competitive FPS games was Quake III. The movement in Quake is really what makes it a game of all time. In 2016, I found Counter Strike: Global Offensive, which I still 
                play today. Later down the line, I participated in the competitive scene at a very  low level but never had the dedication to rise up the ladder, so I stuck to casual 
                play.<br><br>Counter Strike was the gateway to the platform called Steam, which opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me. Since then, I've played so many different 
                genres of games that it's hard to keep track. Though there's one game that really stood out, Skyrim. Not only does it have such a vast world of endless content, but the
                modding scene enabled by Bethesda is gigantic. Fun fact: I have also created a few mods, which is pretty much what made me realize what's so great about game design.
                You can find those mods <a href='https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/68835808?tab=user+files'>here</a>.",

                engineering, and then I realized that maybe engineering isn't all I thought it was, or it could be that I was just completely overwhelmed by the code of ethics that comes 
                with being an engineer.<br><br>In my second semester, I made the decision to switch to computer science. I've always been close to computers, and my dad is also a computer science
                graduate, which definitely influenced my decision. Around the time I switched, I was deep into Skyrim modding, finding an unknown passion for game design, or, I guess, design 
                in general.<br><br>I love being able to see the results of my work, and with computer science, it's really easy to achieve that. Whether it's be designing websites, coding, or 
                creating mods, there's always a way to see the progress of your work instantly.",

                of conditions, events, and the ability to create your own story. Creating something and then being able to jump into the game to test it out is something I'm all about.<br><br>
                I'm also really enjoying web design right now. I'd like to further my knowledge of all these different frameworks being used and really push the limits of what a website can 
                be. I think it'd be fun to do some contract work, or something along those lines, on the side.",
